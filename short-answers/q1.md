# Question
Look at the following code:

```js
let name = 'mike';
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = 'tom';
}
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ['New York City', 'Jersey City'];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  favoriteLocations.unshift('Boston');
}
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?
